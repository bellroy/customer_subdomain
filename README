CustomerSubdomain
=================

This plugin lets you handle separate subdomain for your customers.
The generator assumes that you run RSpec (with Remarkable). Currently RSpec is the only test framework supported.


Installation
============

Please run the following generator:

script/generate customer_subdomain

The generator assumes you want to create a model (by default 'Customer'). If you already have a model,
please specify '--no-model' as an option.

Here is a list of all available options:

--model-name=<model>        Use a different model (Default: Customer)
--subdomain-field=<field>   Use a different field to map against the subdomain (Default: subdomain)
--no-model                  Don't generate the model files (class, migration, spec, ...)


Examples:

- generate subdomain code with defaults (model: Customer, subdomain field: subdomain)
script/generate customer_subdomain

- generate code with changed model
script/generate customer_subdomain --model-name=Account

- don't generate model related code, but use different model in lib's
script/generate customer_subdomain --no-model --model-name=Account


Usage
=======

The helper method 'current_customer' is available in all controllers, helpers and views.
It returns an instance of the Customer matching the subdomain.
